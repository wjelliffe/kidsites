    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals in the world, with their legs alone being taller than many humans. They can reach heights of up to 18 feet and weigh up to 2,600 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giraffes are known for their long necks, which they use to reach high leaves on trees. They are also known for their distinctive spotted patterns, which help them blend in with the trees and bushes of their natural habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giraffes are native to the grasslands of Africa, and are found in many national parks and game reserves throughout the continent. They are social animals, and often live in groups called "towers".
